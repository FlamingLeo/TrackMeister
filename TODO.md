## Suggested Features

- full file browser
- full playlist support with recursive directory scanning and "proper" shuffle
- more advanced auto-scrolling (up and down with defined minimum speed?)
- automatic loop detection (depends on https://bugs.openmpt.org/view.php?id=1675)
- in compact views, if there's no note, try the effects column or volume effects
  column (in that order) instead
- make info bar contents more customizable (filename / title / author toggleable
  individually; possibly also "don't show filename if there's a title")
- master volume control
- runtime configuration of per-track properties
