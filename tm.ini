[TrackMeister]
    ; start in fullscreen mode
    fullscreen = true

    ; uncomment the following line if you don't want files to start playing
    ; right after being opened (very useful for actual compos)
    ;autoplay = false

    ; if a track has a loop, slowly fade out after that
    ; NOTE: by default, playback *stops* after the loop point has been reached;
    ;       to enable loops, set "loop=true" for the files that really use them
    fade out after loop = true

[*.mod]
    ; for Amiga MODs, we want extra little stereo separation (almost mono)
    stereo separation = 20

    ; also disable volume ramping, as ProTracker didn't have that either
    volume ramping = 0

[mod.*]
    ; the same as above, but for MOD files that use the old-school file
    ; naming scheme
    stereo separation = 20
    volume ramping = 0
